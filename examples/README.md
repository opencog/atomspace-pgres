PostgresStorageNode demo
------------------------
The `pgres-storage.scm` has a very short demo of using the
`PostgresStorageNode`. More sophisticated demos with longer
explanations can be found in the https://github.com/opencog/atomspace
git repo, in the various `examples/atomspace/persist*.scm` files.
